# Phaser CV Dungeon

This code aims to become a playable version of my CV since I want some randomness I used [that](https://itnext.io/modular-game-worlds-in-phaser-3-tilemaps-3-procedural-dungeon-3bc19b841cd) example tutorial's code and to not to deal with webpack and stuff much I used my Phaser learning tutorials boiler plate for webpack from [here](https://github.com/Jerga99/phaser-webpack-boilerplate)

Assests and stuff will be later removed with my own stuff.
